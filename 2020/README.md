##### Day 1: Report Repair
So this looks like a Knapsack type problem but just using loops with some shortcuts solved both parts with no delay. I wouldn't
trust my solutions on a larger problem space without further testing though.

##### Day 2: Password Philosophy
Some simple parsing and checks, but I spent longer refactoring to produce generic code usable for both parts of the problem. It's
very Java with a factory ðŸ¤¦.
