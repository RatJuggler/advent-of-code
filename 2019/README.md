##### Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation
Keeping it simple with separate loops for each calculation part.

##### Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm
Defined the Intcode processor as a class and included a test.

##### Day 3: Crossed Wires
My solution is somewhat long-winded, with a whole series of discrete steps, because of how I broke the problem down. I stored each
section of the wires as lines and then worked out all the intersections between them which is a lot of work. On review a better 
solution might have been to just plot the wires into a 2d array simply recording the intersections as they were found.
