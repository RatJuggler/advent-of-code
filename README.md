Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com

I only started in 2019 but it's so much fun I'm going back to 2015 and doing all the years I've missed. I'm also using
it as another learning exercise for Python (3.6+).

###### Some general points about my solutions:

- I always like to have the odd test or two rather than going straight for the answer to prove I'm on the right track.  

- I like to use type hints on function parameters and return types to help clarify the intention of the function.

- I've probably overused regular expressions for parsing instead of simple string splits.

- I often prefer to leave complex processing or calculations unrolled rather than cramming everything onto one line.
This does go against the more Pythonesq goal of making code compact and succinct but I value being able to see the 
discreet logical steps. 

See each year for more comments on the days puzzles.
