Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com

I only started in 2019 but enjoyed it so much I'm doing the previous years. 

I've completed 2015 using Python (3.6+). As I hadn't done much Python before it was an excellent learning exercise.

I've now completed 2016 using Java 11. Certainly seemed a lot harder solving these puzzles in Java rather than Python :thinking:.

##### Some general points about my solutions:

- I always like to have the odd test or two rather than going straight for the answer to prove I'm on the right track. 
But these will be mostly simple test methods using *assert* statements rather than complete separate tests (Note: For
Java this means turning on asserts in the JVM with -ea).

- I try not to pull in additional libraries beyond those of the core language.

- I've probably overused regular expressions for parsing instead of simple string splits.

- I often prefer to leave complex processing or calculations unrolled rather than cramming everything onto one line.
This does go against the more aim of making code compact and succinct but I value being able to see the 
discreet logical steps. 

- For Python I like to use type hints on function parameters and return types to help clarify the intention of the 
function.

See each year for more comments on the days puzzles.
