Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com

- 2020 - In progress now using Java 11.

- 2019 - Started using Python (3.x), but not completed. Need to go back and work on this.

- 2018 - Not started. I hope to use Java 11.

- 2017 - Not started. I hope to use Python (3.x).

- 2016 - Completed using Java 11. Certainly seemed a lot harder solving these puzzles in Java rather than Python :thinking:.

- 2015 - Completed using Python (3.x). Doing As I hadn't done much Python before it was an excellent learning exercise.

##### Some general points about my solutions:

- I always like to have the odd test or two rather than going straight for the answer to prove I'm on the right track. These will 
mostly be simple test methods using *assert* statements rather than complete separate tests (Note: For Java this means turning on 
asserts in the JVM with -ea).

- I try not to pull in additional libraries beyond those of the core language.

- I've probably overused regular expressions for parsing instead of simple string splits.

- I often prefer to leave complex processing or calculations unrolled rather than cramming everything onto one line. This does go 
against the idea of making code compact and succinct but I value being able to see the discreet logical steps.

- In a similar vein some of my solutions may seem over-engineered for what is required, but I like to keep in mind how I would be 
implementing these for a production environment.

- For Python I like to use type hints on function parameters and return types to help clarify the intention of the function.

See each year for more comments on the days puzzles.
